Plans and Tools for WWC's Bay Area Meetup

This repository has been created to track and plan the activities of the [Women Who Code Bay Area Meetup](http://www.meetup.com/Women-Who-Code-East-Bay/).

The meetup takes place Wednesday nights at 1600 Shattuck Ave, Berkeley, CA and focuses on <b>Algorithms and Interview Prep</b>.

Plans for this repo are:

Update with resources for attendees, including:
+ outside information links,
+ algorithm problems previously covered in class,
+ and events participants may find interesting

Participants should feel free to ask questions by opening an issue. Feel free to also request changes by forking the repo and making pull requests.

<strong>Thank you to the [WWC Algorithms-Interview Repo](https://github.com/WomenWhoCode/Algorithms-InterviewPrep) for the initial content in this repo.</strong>
